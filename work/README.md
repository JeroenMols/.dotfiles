# Work
Placeholder add specific extensions for your work environment. These extensions are expected to:

- be placed in a `work/.dotfiles` directory
- follow the same file structure (e.g. `work/dotfiles/zsh/config`)

Alternatively the work specific extensions can be checked out in another location and linked via a symlink:

```
 ln -s ~/dev/.dotfiles ~/.dotfiles/work/.dotfiles 
```
